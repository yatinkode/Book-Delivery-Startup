# Book-Delivery-Startup
Lets find out if a book delivery startup will be profitable to invest more in future month

Assume we are a mail-delivery book startup. You fill out a profile with us about your book preferences, and we will send you 5 books each month for free. Whatever you like you keep and pay for, and whatever you don't like you send back. 

As a company we have to buy our books ahead of time. We took out a loan last month to buy our original batch of books. The value of the loan was the total cost of all the books that we bought.
We made some money back through customers buying our books last month. Next month, we know which books we will be sending to which customers, but we do not know who will buy what books. It costs 0.60/book each way for shipping books to and from customers. 

The question to answer is: 
### Will we be able to both pay back our loan and afford our next book purchase order?
